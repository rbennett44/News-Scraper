# News-Scraper

As a ravid hockey fan, I like to keep in the loop with all the latest news from the NHL.  However, the NHL website is notoriously slow.  Therefore, I thought it a valid goal to scrape the news from the site (thereby bypassing all the ads, etc.) and bring it straight to my screen.  This assignment helped me to do that. 

Here, we are using Mongoose, Morgan, Express, Axios, and Cheerio to aid in this noble cause. 

Hope you like it.
